# Adding Environment

- Move to the **Infrastructure** tab
- And check for “**K8Env**”, in case of the absence of any pre-defined environment create a **new environment**
- Go to the **YAML builder** and paste the contents of the following file - [environment.yaml 
](https://github.com/harness-community/cd-pipeline-sample/blob/main/Core-components/Environments/environment.yaml)
- **Save** it to create a new environment.

Now it's time to [execute the pipeline](docs/project/ExecutePipeline.md)
